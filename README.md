# Interactive Multi-step Form with React and Tailwind CSS

This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge to build an interactive multi-step form. The goal is to create a form that allows users to complete a sequence of steps, go back to previous steps to update their selections, view a summary of their selections on the final step, and confirm their order.

## Overview

Your users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## Built with

This project was built using the following technologies:

- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Challenges

While working on this project, I encountered the following challenges:

- Implementing input validations: I worked on improving the input validation functionality to ensure data integrity.
- Data persistence: I focused on the UI and multi-step functionality, so data does not persist between sessions. Local storage could be implemented for data persistence if needed.
